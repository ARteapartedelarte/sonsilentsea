# Simple smoke example

In this example we will explain how to generate a simple smoke.

## Particle viewable generation

In sssEmit the particles are just empty objects which are not visible in the scene, letting you to generate the most convenient viewable instance.

Before start working ensure yourself to appropriately [start the Blender Game Engine environment](sssEmit-StartingBlender).

### Creating the plane

You can move to the last layer (where the particle empty object will be generated) pressing the keys combination `Alt+0`, and set the upper view (which would be more convenient now) pressing the key `7_`.

To create the plane just go to the bottom panel of the 3D view and press Add/Mesh/Plane

![Plane creation](https://github.com/sanguinariojoe/sonsilentsea/blob/wiki/doc/wiki/images/add_mesh_plane.png?raw=true)

Which will generate a plane of 2x2 units (probably you are seeing it completely black due to there are no any light in this layer).
You may name it **particle.smoke**
Let's start scaling the plane by a factor of 0.5 (press the `S` key, and then, with the `Ctrl` key pressed move the cursor closer to the centre of the object until the factor reach the value 0.5).

### Setting the material

To set the material we must start creating a convenient UV coordinates. 
To do that, with the plane selected, press the `TAB` key (which will enter in the edit mode), and then press the `U` key (I'm assuming that all the vertexes are selected, otherwise press the key `A` as many times as needed to wet all the object highlighted in an orange color), selecting the **Unwrap** option:

Now your object has a set of UV coordinates. Press the `TAB` key again to exit the edit mode.

To create the material go to the properties panel and select **the materials tab**, pressing the button **New** to generate a new material for our object.

You may call it **particle.smoke** again. In the **shading section** we must mark the **Shadeless** option (which will neglect the lighting effects), in the **Options section** the option **Object color** must be selected, and finally in the **transparency section** the **transparency** with an **alpha value of 0.0** must be activated:

### Setting the smoke texture

If you have done all the previous tasks probably you are seeing that your plane is invisible (it is transparent). Now let's set a texture to conveniently modify the alpha value. First download and save the following texture:

![Smoke alpha texture](https://github.com/sanguinariojoe/sonsilentsea/blob/wiki/doc/wiki/images/particle_smoke.png?raw=true)

And the go to the **textures** tab, and press the **new** button to create a new texture:

![Adding a new texture](https://github.com/sanguinariojoe/sonsilentsea/blob/wiki/doc/wiki/images/new_texture.png?raw=true)

You may name it **particle.smoke**, and select as type **Image or Movie**. Then, in the section **Image** you can use the button open to load the texture that you already downloaded. Now you only need to go to the section **Influence** and deactivate **Color** and activate **Alpha**:

In this moment your object has recovered the visibility in the 3D screen.

### Setting the color

Now the object color is controlled in the **Object tab**, section **display**. Let's set a grey color (0.025, 0.025, 0.025):
