# Starting blender

If you have not changed the default blender preferences it will start ready for graphics design work, but we are interested in use it as a game workbench, so let's change some settings.

_During the tutorials it will be assumed that these changes have been performed._

## Remove the default cube

Just select the starting cube and remove it from the scene pressing the key `X` and answering yes pressing the `INTRO` key.

## Set the game environment

### Blender game engine renderer

Let's start changing the renderer to the BGE selecting it in the top panel (Info panel):

### Game logic working environment

We can use the predefined environment for the game logic, selecting it in the top panel again:

### GLSL shading

In order to see the final visual results the GLSL shading view must be activated.
First press the key `N` to show the 3D view properties panel, and go down to the shading section (click on it to deplegate its content). Here you can move from the Multitexture shading to the GLSL one:

You can press the key `N` to hide the panel again.

Finally the objects must be shown in texture mode (probably you will change this set several times during your work, just remember to set it to texture mode before launching the simulation):

## Saving the new environment as the default one

Optionally you can save this setup as the default one pressing the keys combination `Ctrl+U` and the `INTRO` key to confirm the command.
